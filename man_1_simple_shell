.SH NAME
Simple Shell \- A simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
After programm being compiled with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o prog
Launch your simple shell in you shell terminal by typing ./prog
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple Shell is a basic command-line interpreter that allows users
to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It supports
basic functionality for executing single commands.
The shell does not support pipes, redirections, or semicolons and
commands must be typed in full. No support of alias or shortcuts.

When a user runs the shell, it displays a prompt (`$HugoAdrien/[CWD]/$ `) and waits for
user input. After a command is entered, the shell attempts to execute
it by invoking the appropriate program. If the command is not found,
an error message is displayed. The prompt reappears after every command
execution. The shell also handles the following features:
.SH MANDATORY FEATURES
1. Display prompt (`$HugoAdrien/[CWD]/$ `).
2. Wait for user input and process commands.
3. Execute commands using `execve`.
4. Display error messages if the command is not found.
5. Handle End-of-File `Ctrl+D`.
6. Handle `CTRL+C` to prevent the shell from quitting when pressed.
7. Exit the shell cleanly when the `exit` command is entered.

.SH SIGNALS HANDLING
1. \fBCTRL+D\fR: Ends the input stream and terminates the shell session gracefully. If \fBCTRL+D\fR is pressed, the shell will exit.
2. \fBCTRL+C\fR: The shell ignores \fBCTRL+C\fR signals to prevent the process from terminating when the user presses \fBCTRL+C\fR. The prompt will remain active for further input.

.SH EXIT STATUS
On success, the shell returns a status code of 0.
On error (e.g., command not found), the shell returns a status code of 2.
.SH EXAMPLES
To execute a command in the shell:
.RS
$ ls
.RE

If a command cannot be found: like 'school'
.RS
$ school : command not found
./simple_shell: No such file or directory
.RE

To exit the shell:
.RS
$ exit
.RE
